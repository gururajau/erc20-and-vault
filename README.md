**ERC20 and Vault Contracts README**

## Introduction

Welcome to the README for ERC20 and Vault Contracts! This document provides a brief overview of these contracts and how to use them.

### ERC20 Contract

The ERC20 contract is a standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows token transfers between addresses, querying balances, and approving delegated transfers.

### Vault Contract

The Vault contract is a secure way to store and manage ERC20 tokens. It offers features like multi-signature support, time-locked withdrawals, and permission controls.

## Usage

To use these contracts:

1. **Deploy**: Deploy the contracts to an Ethereum network using Truffle, Remix, or any Ethereum development environment.

2. **Interact**: Use Web3.js or a similar library to interact with the contracts. Transfer tokens, approve spending, deposit and withdraw from the vault, and manage permissions.
